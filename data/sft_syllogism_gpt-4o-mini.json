The first statement tells us that there is an intersection between birds and philosophers, meaning some birds are indeed philosophers. The second statement asserts that philosophers are not mortals, indicating that no overlap exists between philosophers and mortals. Given that some birds belong to the group of philosophers, and that none of the philosophers are mortals, it logically follows that those birds that are philosophers cannot be mortals. Therefore, we can conclude that some birds are not mortals. </think>\n<answer> Yes </answer>",
